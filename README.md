# TRRepo

This is the readme file for the Tech Returners practice assignments and material. 

The c file in this repo was created as part of a paired programming exercise where our task was to count the number of button presses it would take to move a cursor around a grid of letters and numbers to create a particular string. Classic codewars challenge.
